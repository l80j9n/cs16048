1.    A mixture of gas consists   of 30%   H2, 40%   He,   and   30%   N2 by volume. The   mixture   is expanded   isentropically from 5000 kPa and 600oC to   200   kPa. Calculate the work produced per unit   mass   of the   mixture.
2.      Propane and air are supplied to an internal   combustion   engine   such   that,   on   a   mass basis, the air-fuel   ratio   is   16 when the   pressure   is 95   kPa and the   temperature   is 30oC. The mixture is compressed such   that the   ratio   of the   initial   volume to the final volume is 9.5 (Compression   ratio V1/V2    = 9.5).   If the   compression process is isentropic, determine the   required work   input for this   compression   process in kJ/kg   of mixture.
3.    A mixture of hydrocarbon gases   is   composed   of 60%   methane,   25%   propane, and   15%   butane   by weight代 写MAE 115 APPLIED ENGINEERING THERMODYNAMICS Hw#8Python
代做程序编程语言. This mixture   is compressed from   100   kPa and 20oC   to   1000   kPa in a reversible, isothermal, steady-flow   compressor.   Calculate   the work and heat transfer for this compression per unit   mass of the   mixture.
4.      Prove that the enthalpy of an ideal gas is   only   a function   of temperature.
5.    Verify the validity of the 4th    Maxwell relation for refrigerant   R-134a   at   50oC   and   0.7   MPa.
6.      Derive an expression governing ∆u, ∆ℎ, and   ∆s   for a gas   undergoing an   isothermal process and under an equation   of state   P(v   −   a)   =   RT.
7.    The pressure of a fluid   always decreases   during   an   adiabatic   throttling   process.   Is this also the case for the temperature?
8.      Estimate the Joule-Thompson coefficient of refrigerant R-134a at 40   psia   and 60oF.
